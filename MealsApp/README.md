# Meals App

A simple Food app, to demonstrate Navigation and State Mangement functionalities. It is good starting app to learn these technologies. The app can serve as Frontend of any simple Food app. The home page shows different food category which we can choose from. CLicking on any of them list the meals under that category. If we want to look at a meal in detail we can also do that. The Navigation in between these pages is achieved using React Navigation. A tab for favourite meals is also present. In this tab all the meal which we have marked a favourite are listed. The app though being a dummy frontend is cpapble of maintaining session to change Favourite Meals in accordance of User response. The state mangegment is done using Redux. We also have a filters menu using which we can filter the food as per our needs.

This app is developed using Expo and to running the app on real device will require Expo Client App (Expo Go) and the scanning the QR code generated when we run the server.
