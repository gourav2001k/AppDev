# Goals App

A really simple Goal managing app where we can add new goals,remove a goal. Fairly simple UI. The changes made on the goal list is retained only till the session lasts. Reloading the app will discard previous changes. App can be run on a emulator as well as on a real device.

This app is developed using Expo and to running the app on real device will require Expo Client App (Expo Go) and the scanning the QR code generated when we run the server
